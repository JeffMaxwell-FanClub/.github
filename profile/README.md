## About

Welcome to the **Jeff Maxwell Fan Club** (JMFC) Official Repository. This organization is dedicated to preserving, stretching, and celebrating the legacy of Jeff. Whether you are here for the beard mechanics, the impeccable aspect ratio, or the general aura of success, you have come to the right place.

This repository serves as the central documentation for the **Maxwell Protocol**.

## Features

Why integrate Jeff into your life? Here are the specs:

* **High Scalability:** Capable of being stretched to infinite widths without losing charisma.
* **Beard Rendering Engine:** proprietary `v3.0` follicle simulation for maximum texture.
* **Low Latency Wisdom:** Instant responses to complex problems (results may vary).
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on LinkedIn, GitHub, and in casual conversation.
